### Titles

‚úÖ You can have up to four levels of titles

```markdown

#### Probably not used all that often
```

‚ùå Only letters (a-z), numbers, underscores and colons are allowed in titles

```markdown
#### Emoji is not allowed üò¢
#### Hyphens are not allowed thus sugar-free is not valid

#### No accented characters sorry Beyonc√©
```

‚ùå Titles must start with a leading space

```markdown
#This is not valid
```

‚úÖ You can place your titles inside a single parens

```markdown
